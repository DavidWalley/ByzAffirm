Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerant distributed datastore that is NOT Hashgraph

IMPORTANT: I am not a lawyer and this repo does not contain any valid legal advice. Any and all code added to this repo is meant for discussion of my thoughts and experiments only. As a non-lawyer, I cannot say if any or all of the code violates one or several patents, so do not execute, copy or encorporate any of this code into any project for any purpose whatsoever. 

I hereby put any original work or ideas of mine in this repo under the MIT license, but if anything is covered by the Hashgraph patents, then obviously you have to contact Swirlds, the owner, for further information.

Hashgraph is a very promising, mathematically sound scheme for replacing blockchain - the basic algorithm that BitCoin and related cryptocurrencies use. While provably superior on many fronts to any blockchain variant including Etherium, many are rejecting Hashgraph because of the patents claimed by Swirlds and inventor Leemon Baird.
